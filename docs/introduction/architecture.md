# UniHub Architecture

## Overview

UniHub follows a modern web application architecture, designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The system is built using a client-server model with a clean separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (Client)

The frontend of UniHub is built using Next.js, a React framework that provides server-side rendering, routing, and other performance optimizations.

Key aspects of the frontend architecture:

- **Component-Based Structure**: Organized around reusable UI components
- **Page-Based Routing**: Using Next.js file-based routing system
- **State Management**: Utilizing React context and hooks for state management
- **API Integration**: Communicating with the backend via RESTful API calls
- **Responsive Design**: Supporting various device sizes through responsive layouts
- **Internationalization**: Supporting multiple languages through i18n

### 2. Backend (API Server)

The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js, providing a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.

Key aspects of the backend architecture:

- **Controllers-Routes-Models Pattern**: Organized around feature-specific modules
- **RESTful API Design**: Following REST principles for API endpoints
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT-based authentication for secure access
- **Database Integration**: Using Sequelize ORM for database operations
- **Input Validation**: Validating all input data for security and consistency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Database

UniHub uses MySQL as its primary database, with a relational schema designed to support all features.

Key aspects of the database architecture:

- **Relational Schema**: Normalized database design
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintaining data integrity
- **Indexing**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Transactions**: Used for operations requiring ACID compliance

### 4. External Services

UniHub integrates with various external services to provide enhanced functionality:

- **OpenAI API**: For AI-assisted features
- **Cloud Storage**: For storing user-uploaded files
- **Email Service**: For notifications and communications

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials (email/password)
2. Backend validates credentials
3. If valid, backend generates JWT token
4. Token is returned to frontend
5. Frontend stores token in browser storage
6. Token is included in Authorization header for subsequent requests

### Feature Flow (Example: Quiz Creation)

1. User navigates to quiz creation page
2. User fills in quiz details and questions
3. Frontend validates input and sends to backend
4. Backend performs additional validation
5. Backend stores quiz data in database
6. Response is sent back to frontend
7. Frontend updates UI to reflect successful creation

## System Boundaries

The UniHub system has several external integration points:

- **Browser Environment**: Where the client application runs
- **Database Server**: Where persistent data is stored
- **External APIs**: Third-party services integrated for specific features
- **File Storage**: Where user-uploaded files are stored

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on both client and server sides
- **HTTPS**: All communications encrypted
- **Sanitization**: Prevention of injection attacks
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration

## Deployment Architecture

UniHub uses a modern cloud deployment approach:

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel for optimal Next.js hosting
- **Backend**: Deployed on Vercel serverless functions
- **Database**: Cloud-hosted MySQL instance
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale in several ways:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more API server instances
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and sharding capabilities
- **Caching**: Implementation of caching layers where appropriate
- **Microservices Potential**: Architecture designed to allow breaking into microservices in the future if needed
