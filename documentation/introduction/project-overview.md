- Visualize learning progress over time

## Target Users

UniHub is designed primarily for:

1. **College/University Students**: Seeking to organize their academic life and improve their learning outcomes
2. **Self-Learners**: Looking for tools to structure their independent learning journey
3. **Educators**: Wanting to provide additional resources and support to their students
4. **Study Groups**: Needing tools to organize shared learning materials

## Technical Approach

The UniHub platform is built using modern web technologies, following a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based application with Next.js, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, offering a robust API for the frontend to interact with
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data storage with JSON field support
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system with refresh token rotation
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using:
  - OpenAI for embeddings and content generation
  - Qdrant for vector storage and similarity search
  - Advanced document processing pipeline

## Key Technical Features

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
UniHub implements a sophisticated RAG architecture that:
- Processes and indexes learning materials
- Creates vector embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieves relevant context for AI-powered features
- Generates educational content based on user-specific needs

### Document Processing
- Text extraction from multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX)
- Smart chunking strategies for optimal retrieval
- Vector embedding generation with fallback mechanisms
- Batch processing for performance optimization

### AI Content Generation
- Context-aware note creation based on learning materials
- Custom-difficulty quiz generation
- Intelligent chat responses with material-specific knowledge
- Markdown formatting for well-structured educational content

## Current Status

UniHub is in active development with the following components implemented:
- Core backend infrastructure with RESTful API endpoints
- RAG architecture for AI-powered content generation
- MySQL database schema with efficient querying
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Topic, material, note, and quiz management
- Statistics tracking for learning activities
- Vector-based document retrieval and search

## Future Direction
